# Story 1.1: Source Consistency Audit

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** product maintainer,
**I want** to audit source code and documentation for language and helper consistency,
**so that** the project remains aligned with standards without disturbing the Spanish end-user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A documented checklist exists that enumerates code and documentation areas requiring English-only alignment and naming cleanup (UI strings may remain in Spanish by design).
2. A written summary identifies duplicated or inconsistent helper utilities (for example, JWT validation) and recommends which shared module should host the canonical implementation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Compile an inventory of non-English or mixed-language strings across source files, backend responses, and documentation (skip UI strings intended for Spanish users) (AC: 1)
    - [x] Traverse `src/`, `docs/`, and configuration files following the repository layout to flag mismatches [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
    - [x] Record findings in a checklist file under `docs/stories` or equivalent audit log referenced in AC (AC: 1)
- [x] Review shared helper usage to detect duplication or divergence from standards (AC: 2)
    - [x] Compare JWT/auth helper usage in API routes against the shared implementations in `@/utils` [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
    - [x] Document required consolidations and note impacted files for the follow-up refactor story (AC: 2)
- [x] Summarise audit output and store it alongside the epic for easy reference, ensuring results are in English (AC: 1, 2)

## Dev Notes
- Repository layout highlights where frontend, backend, and shared helpers reside; focus the audit on `src/pages/api/**`, `src/utils`, `src/lib`, and documentation under `docs/` [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- Authentication helpers `checkAdmin` and `validateUser` already live in `src/utils/auth.ts`, with some endpoints duplicating logicï¿½confirm actual usage during the audit [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Coding standards emphasise avoiding duplicated helper logic and keeping shared code under `src/utils` or `src/lib`; use these expectations when flagging issues [Source: architecture/coding-standards-critical-rules.md]
- Maintain naming conventions outlined in the architecture when suggesting cleanup (components PascalCase, hooks `use*`, API routes kebab-case, etc.) [Source: architecture/naming-conventions.md]
- Development workflow notes the manual regression checklist; capture audit outputs so subsequent stories can plan regression after refactors [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- No prior stories exist; there are no previous insights to inherit.

### Testing
- No automated test suite is present; document findings clearly so later refactor story can introduce targeted tests [Source: architecture/testing-status.md]
- Manual QA checklist (login, prediction CRUD, results publication, ranking refresh) should remain the baseline regression after refactors begin [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
OpenAI GPT-4.1

### Debug Log References
- None.

### Completion Notes List
- Completed language audit focusing on developer-facing text; documented required follow-up items.
- Identified and recorded helper duplication across prediction API endpoints for consolidation.

### File List
- docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Story deliverables are documentation-only; verified the new audit report file exists and enumerates all required findings.
- No code modifications were made in this story, so no additional refactoring performed at this stage.

### Requirements Coverage
- AC1 satisfied: docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md lists every developer-facing string or documentation section requiring English alignment and notes intentional Spanish UI copy.
- AC2 satisfied: same report captures helper duplication across prediction endpoints with a consolidation recommendation for @/utils/auth.

### Test Strategy Evaluation
- Story correctly records that no automated suite exists yet; manual regression baseline documented for follow-up refactor work.
- No tests required for this audit deliverable.

### Risk Summary
- Low risk: outputs are advisory artifacts feeding the next story; no production behaviour was changed.

### Recommendations
- Use Story 1.2 to address the flagged helper consolidation and translation items.
- When implementing refactors, ensure developer-facing errors adopt English wording while preserving Spanish user messages.

### Suggested Status
- Ready for Done
