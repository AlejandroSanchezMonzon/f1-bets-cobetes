# Story 1.5: Translate Database Schema Comments to English

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** product maintainer,
**I want** the database schema documentation to use English comments,
**so that** developers have consistent, English-only guidance across the codebase and schema.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All comments in `db/schema.sql` are translated to English while preserving the original technical meaning.
2. Documentation (`docs/index.md` or relevant audit logs) reflects that the schema comment translation is complete.
3. Manual regression checklist is noted as not required for this documentation-only change.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Translate Spanish comments in `db/schema.sql` to English; ensure tone matches existing documentation (AC: 1)
- [x] Update `docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md` to mark the schema comment item as resolved (AC: 2)
- [x] Confirm no other files reference the Spanish versions (AC: 1)
- [x] Record in the Dev Notes that manual regression is not required (documentation-only) (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes
- Source of truth for the schema is `db/schema.sql`; translate inline comments carefully without altering table definitions.
- Audit findings log currently flags the schema comment translation as pending backlog; update once done [Source: docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md]
- Manual regression not required for documentation-only change [Source: architecture/testing-status.md]

### Testing
- Documentation-only change: proofread the translated comments for clarity and accuracy [Source: architecture/testing-status.md]
