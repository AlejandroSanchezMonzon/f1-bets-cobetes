# Story 1.3: Documentation Refresh & Developer Quick Start

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** product maintainer,
**I want** to refresh the project documentation and highlight the enforced coding standards,
**so that** contributors have an up-to-date English reference that matches the current architecture and helper refactors.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `docs/index.md` lists all current documents with accurate descriptions, including the new audit and helper consolidation artifacts.
2. README and architecture docs (including the “Architecture & Documentation” section) reflect the latest helper consolidation, testing expectations, and quick-start guidance (in English only).
3. A concise “Developer Quick Start” subsection (README or dedicated doc) summarizes required conventions: coding standards, helper usage, manual regression expectations, and current limitations (no automated tests yet).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Update `docs/index.md` to include/adjust entries for:
  - `docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md`
  - `docs/stories/1.2.auth-helper-consolidation.md`
  - `docs/qa/gates/1.1-source-consistency-audit.yml` and `docs/qa/gates/1.2-auth-helper-consolidation.yml`
- [x] Refresh README “Architecture & Documentation” and “Getting Started” sections to reference the latest helper consolidation outcomes and manual regression expectation (AC: 2, 3)
- [x] Update relevant architecture shards (`docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards-critical-rules.md`) to note centralised auth helpers and English-only developer messaging (AC: 2)
- [x] Add/improve a “Developer Quick Start” bullet list (e.g., in README) reiterating conventions: `@/utils/auth` usage, coding standards link, manual regression checklist, missing automated tests (AC: 3)
- [x] Proofread for English consistency; ensure no residual `/context` references remain (AC: 1, 2)

## Dev Notes
- Documentation index structure is described in the architecture doc and enforced by previous doc sharding; keep the same section format when adding entries [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- Coding standards highlight where helpers live and forbid duplication; explicitly call this out in quick-start guidance [Source: architecture/coding-standards-critical-rules.md]
- Backend architecture now relies on shared `validateUser` and English developer messaging; ensure docs mention this to avoid regressions [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Development workflow expects the manual regression checklist after backend changes; include this in the quick-start summary [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Reference audit outputs for completed cleanup status: `docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md` captures resolved vs pending items (e.g., DB schema comments) [Source: docs/stories/1.1-source-consistency-audit-findings.md]

### Testing
- Documentation-only story: verify links render correctly (`pnpm build` optional) and manually read updated sections for English consistency [Source: architecture/testing-status.md]

## QA Results

## QA Results 

### Review Date: 2025-10-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Documentation Review 
- Verified README, index, and architecture shards now reference the consolidated auth helpers, quick-start guidance, and QA gate locations. 
- Confirmed coding standards document includes English-only developer messaging and shared helper usage. 

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage 
- AC1: docs/index.md includes audit and helper consolidation references; new QA gate section present. 
- AC2: README and architecture docs mention helper consolidation, testing expectation, and point to the updated stories. 
- AC3: Developer quick-start section in README summarises conventions and manual regression requirements. 

### Risk Summary 
- Minimal risk: documentation-only updates. 

### Recommendations 
- Ensure future stories keep docs/index.md and README in sync after each major change. 

### Suggested Status 
- Ready for Done
