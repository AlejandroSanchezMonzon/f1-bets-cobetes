# Future Considerations
- Add background job or webhook support if automated result ingestion is introduced.
- Implement refresh tokens or session renewal to avoid abrupt logouts mid-weekend.
- Consolidate authentication helpers to remove inline duplication.
- Explore lightweight monitoring (Vercel Analytics, Logflare) for production visibility.
