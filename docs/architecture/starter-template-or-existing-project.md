# Starter Template or Existing Project
- **Origin:** Custom-built Astro 5 project; not based on an external starter template.
- **Implications:** All patterns (auth helpers, REST endpoints, UI behaviors) were developed in-house. Agents should follow the conventions documented here because third-party starter documentation will not apply out of the box.
