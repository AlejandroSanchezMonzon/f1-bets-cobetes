# Observability and Operations
- **Logging:** `console.log`/`console.error` inside API handlers captured by Vercel; no central log aggregation.
- **Monitoring:** none configured; rely on Vercel analytics and manual smoke checks.
- **Metrics:** not instrumented; ranking accuracy verified manually after recalculation.
